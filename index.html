                About the Legend
            </h1>



            <p>
                ☛ Emperor Vikramaditya of Ujjain started Vikram Samvat in 57 BC and it is believed that this calendar
                follows his victory over the Saka in 56 B.C. Originally, the title Vikramaditya had been bestowed upon a
                legendary king of Ujjain, India, famed for his wisdom, valor and magnanimity<br><br>
                ☛ We all have heard of the stories like Betal Pacchisi and Simhasan Battisi. It is known he ruled India
                with Ujjain as capital, had a brother Bhatti and poets like Kalidasa were in his court.<br><br>
                ☛ Vikramaditya ruled over parts of India in the 1st century BCE, and popular culture credits him with
                starting the Vikrama Samvat era in 57 BCE. He is featured in hundreds of traditional Indian legends,
                including the popular Vikram and Betaal, which is based on Baital Pachisi.<br><br>
                ☛ What is the history of Parmar?
                The Paramara or the Parmars are a Rajput fraternity in the region of South Asia. The founder of the
                Paramara dynasty was king Upendra or Krishnaraja . It was found in the 9th century and its capital was
                Ujjain. The capital of this dynasty was later on changed to Dharan Nagri, also known as Dhar.
                <br><br>
                ☛ Did Vikramaditya ruled whole Asia?
                Vikramaditya was the king of Ujjain, who was famous for his wisdom, valor and generosity.<strong> He had
                    organized his rule over the whole of Asia.</strong>
                <br><br>
                ☛The Paramaras rose to power after the decline of the Gurjara Pratiharas. Upendra Krishnaraja was the
                founder of this dynasty.<strong> Dharanagar </strong> was the capital of the Paramaras
                <br><br>
                ☛ Samrat Vikramaditya fought a hard battle and won back his kingdom. This victory over the Sakas in 57
                BCE marks the beginning of the Vikram Samvat. Vikram Samvat is the commonly used Hindu calendar, and
                rightly so, in honor of one of the most courageous and able emperors Bharat has seen. His impact was so
                profound that later kings and rulers adopted the title Vikramaditya to show off their military and
                administrative prowess.
                <br><br>
                ☛He was not only an able Kshatriya but also a great administrator. His Prime Minister was Bhatti, who
                was not only his brother but also a wise counselor. His court is said to have been adorned by the best
                scholars. His court’s Nine Gems (Navaratnas) were masters of their respective fields.
                <br><br>
                ☛ They were Dhanvantari (medicine), Kshapanaka (treasurer and grammarian), Amarasimha (grammarian),
                Shanku (policy-maker), Ghatakarapara (literature), Kalidasa (poet), Vetala Bhatta (war strategist),
                Varamihira (astronomer and mathematician) and Vararuchi (astronomer). All these scholars authored
                treatises in their fields of knowledge. These texts are an inspiration to this day.
                <br><br>
                ☛ Vikramaditya is mentioned in the Skanda, Bhavishya, and Bhavisyottar Puranas. Itihasa and Puranas have
                been a part of Bharat’s oral traditions since time immemorial. Due to this, there has been a feeling
                that Bharatiyas lack a sense of history. However, since the tales have been passed orally, there could
                be a marginal element of error (exception and not the norm).
                <br><br>
                ☛ Many scholars have, therefore, considered Vikramaditya to be a mythical figure. Moreover, with several
                kings adopting the title Vikramaditya during later times, things have become complicated. Undoubtedly,
                such a great and honest ruler once walked the earth and ruled over an empire from his capital at Ujjain.
                <br><br>
                ☛ Bharat’s Navy named its aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya after the great ruler. Even the postal
                department recognized the value of Samrat Vikramaditya by launching commemorative stamps on December 22,
                2016. The Ujjain Municipal Corporation (UMC) recreated Samrat’s courtroom on Vikram Teela. It is a
                hillock located behind Mahakal temple and it is said that the Samrat’s throne lay buried here for
                centuries. The recreated courtroom houses a 26-feet high statue of Vikramaditya, his throne Sinhasan
                Battisi, and life-size statues of the Navaratnas of his court.
                <br><br>
                ☛Such is the greatness of Samrat Vikramaditya that every ruler who considered himself militarily and
                administratively successful has felt compelled to adopt Samrat’s name as his title. Bharat has produced
                several valorous and devoted sons of the soil whose life stories encourage us and inspire us to emulate
                their qualities. Unfortunately, our history textbooks also ignore many of these great kings, emperors,
                dynasties, and kingdoms. Due to this, future generations will always remain ignorant about such great
                personalities. It is, therefore, our duty to ensure that we make our youth aware of Bharat’s heroes.
